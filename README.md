## Description

This repository is for Spezia Machine Learning team. This application is for spice's image recognition by using Convolutional Neural Network, also known as CNN or ConvNet, is a class of neural networks for machine learning model. This model using 3 layers of CNN and have final accuracy around 0.9905 and validation accuracy 0.7662.  

#### Technologies

- Tensorflow
- Flask
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Documentation

1. Collecting and labeling dataset from google image
2. Pre-processing the dataset 
3. Create the Model using Tensorflow
4. Save the model into .h5 format file
5. Create the app.py to build an API using FLask and preprocess the input
6. Serve Flask API by typing in terminal
```bash 
  python app.py
```
7. It will show the endpoint and log
8. Test the API using Postman or similar apps
```bash 
  https://external-ip-address:port/predict
``` 
9. You can just simply test the API using test.ipynb in this repository
